#  Stock Movement Analysis Based on Social Media Sentiment
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the correlation between social media sentiment and stock market movements. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the project aims to extract sentiments from user-generated content (e.g., Telegram messages) and assess their impact on stock price trends. Ultimately, the project seeks to build a model that can forecast stock price movements based on aggregated sentiment data, helping in decision-making for investments or market analysis.
