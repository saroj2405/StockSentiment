#  Stock Movement Analysis Based on Social Media Sentiment
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the correlation between social media sentiment and stock market movements. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the project aims to extract sentiments from user-generated content (e.g., Telegram messages) and assess their impact on stock price trends. Ultimately, the project seeks to build a model that can forecast stock price movements based on aggregated sentiment data, helping in decision-making for investments or market analysis.
The project performs the following tasks:

1.Data Collection: Gathered social media messages (e.g., Telegram) and stock market data.

2.Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and formatted text, timestamps, and stock data.

3.Sentiment Analysis: Used TextBlob to compute sentiment polarity and categorize as positive, negative, or neutral.

4.Feature Engineering: Created temporal features and aggregated sentiment scores.

5.Data Analysis: Explored correlations between sentiment trends and stock price movements.

6.Model Development: Built and evaluated predictive models for stock price trends based on sentiment.

7.Insights and Results: Derived actionable insights and evaluated sentiment impact on market trends.
